BitTorrent Sync Dockerfile
==========================

This will build a [docker](http://www.docker/) image that runs [BitTorrent
Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html).

## Getting the image

There are various ways to get the image onto your system:


The preferred way (but using most bandwidth for the initial image) is to
get our docker trusted build like this:


```
docker pull kartoza/btsync
```

To build the image yourself without apt-cacher (also consumes more bandwidth
since deb packages need to be refetched each time you build) do:

```
docker build -t kartoza/btsync git://github.com/kartoza/docker-btsync
```

To build with apt-cache (and minimised download requirements) do you need to
clone this repo locally first and modify the contents of 71-apt-cacher-ng to
match your cacher host. Then build using a local url instead of directly from
github.

```
git clone git://github.com/kartoza/docker-btsync
```

Now edit ``71-apt-cacher-ng`` then do:

```
docker build -t kartoza/btsync .
```

## Run


To create a running container do:

```
docker run --name "myname.kartoza.com" \
	--restart=always \
	--hostname="myname.kartoza.com" \
	-e SECRET=123456 \
	-e DEVICE=somedevice.kartoza.com \
	-v /home/blah/yourshare:/web \
	-d -t kartoza/btsync
```

You should use the following environment variables to pass a 
user DEVICE name (it will show up as this in your docker sync lists) and SECRET
(use a read only secret normally). 

* -e SECRET=<secret> 
* -e DEVICE=<device name>

We recommend that you share your storage directory as a volume mounted
as /web into the container - this will allow you to destroy and
recreate the container without losing you synced data.

Use this environment variable if you don't want to provide SECRET, but want
to keep the container running (useful in rancher when SECRET is not provided).

* -e STANDBY_MODE=TRUE
